## Hi there 👋

# Here are a few things about me... 

I decided to change my career path from Team Leadership in Sporting Environments to become a software developer.
To do this, I enrolled in a [Northcoders](https://www.northcoders.com) bootcamp where myself and a group of other students worked on learning the tech to become full-stack devs. We have all recently graduated with our own individual [projects](https://curious-meringue-981ef5.netlify.app) and a final [group project](https://breen-team-fe.vercel.app). 

Outside of coding I am an avid sports person, focussed mainly on Climbing and Cycling.

# Current languages and techs;
- Css
- Javascript
- HTML
- Drizzle ORM
- Node.js
- React

# Currently learning;
- Tailwind
- Typescript + Next.js
